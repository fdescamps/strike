TODO:
* fix generalised buttons (or enforce ontouchend="code()")
* document autotitle standards
* figure out tabBaView for real.
* fix back button in header and tabBar

QUESTIONS:
* bindscrollers / rebind scrollers in core... hmmm
* bindNavLinks - what should be the default behaviour
* autotitles - deafult/override behaviour?
* do window.scrollTo(0,1) automatically?
* message system in core, or in manager? - can't use messaging in core if seperate.

h1. Here is Strike mobile

Welcome to the Strike Module. Ready to make stuff for your fingers? Strike is a small Javascript toolbox and framework to help you quickly develop mobile web applications for modern smart phones and mobile devices. It provides page transitions, commonly used styles for UI elements, GEO location and orientation handling, test tools, and more!

You can use as little or as much as you need - you can combine it with your favorite DOM library, or use ours.

h2. Overview

Strike is comprised of a few parts:
* Strike$ DOM helper
* The Strike core library
* Web-based iPhone emulator

Features:
* transitions
* templating
* geo location
* internationalization

Third party:
It makes use of: 
Base.js -  simple object-oriented class extension
SASS - for CSS generation
John Resig's microtemplating - templating
iScroll - fixed position with scrollable area

h1. Starting a new project

Once you have your killer idea, it's time to get to work.

Sketch out your app in HTML - defining the pages as DIV elements

* add javascript lucky library

bc. <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="@{'public/javascripts/lucky.js'}"></script>

Add Strike.onready() - Strike.show("#home");

h2. Testing with emulator

The Strike framework includes a handy web-based iPhone emulator for doing quick tests on your app as you develop. It requires a webkit-based browser.

http://localhost:9000/@emulator

The emulator can be rotated by using the shift key, with the left and right arrow keys. The "phone" will be rotated to the left or right, and the orientation event will fire.


h3.GEO simulation

The play!mobile emulator includes a handy "map picker" for faking your geolocation - 
Strike.locate() will popup a map. Can search, or drag to a point. Single click to select.

h2. Road Map

We are trying to describe what this mobile module can do

h3. Development

h4. Day to day development 

This module should help any developers to make a web mobile application

    * provide a unifying way to switch betwwen mobile and desktop version
    * simulate geolocation
    * simulate screen size
    * simulate touch events
    * simulate orientation change
    * provide tools for handling offline data and affline events

h4. Continous integration

    * provide unit and functional testing for the application
    
h3. Production

This module will bring a production mode for managing

    * file size: compression of css/html/images in 1 file
    * application cache
    
h2. Strike reserved words & classes

* Global scoped variables:
iScroll
Base
Strike$
$ (can be changed with Strike$.noConflict)
Strike
StrikeMan
StrikeCon

DEPRECATED: Prototype additions (See Strike$ docs)

* Classes and IDs that are meaningful to Strike
.back
.button
.page
.i18n
